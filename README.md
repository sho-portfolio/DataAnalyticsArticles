# Data Analytics Resources
Excellent resources relating to data analytics


## discussion on different types of analytics (lexicon and topology)
- https://hbr.org/1971/07/how-to-choose-the-right-forecasting-technique
- discussion on types of basic forcasting techniques:
  - qaualitative (delphi method, market research, panel consensus, visionary forecast, historical analogy)
  - time-series & projection (moving average, exponential smoothing, box-jenkins, X-11, trend projections)
  - casual methods (regression model, econometric, intention-to-buy & anticipation surveys, input-output  model, economic input-output model, diffusion index, lading indicator, life-cycle analysis)


## quant trading strategy walk through (part 3 in the most interesting)

## phi coefficient (correlation between 2 dichotomous (e.g. boolean) variables)
- https://www.slideshare.net/plummer48/what-is-a-phi-coefficient
- [a simple worked example on how to compute the phi coefficient]

## point biserial correlation (correlation between a dichotomous and a continuous variable)
